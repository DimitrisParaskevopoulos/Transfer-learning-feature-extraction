# Feature extraction transfer learning for great results with a small dataset
Transfer learning is leveraging what a state of the art Deep Learning model has already learned

## Key features
* Deep Learning for computer vision
* feature extraction for accurate predictions since our dataset is similar to **ImageNet** where the TensorflowHub model was trained
* tensorboard callback to track ML training results

## Code and resources
* **Python version**: 3.9
* **Packages**: zipfile, os, matplotlib, datetime, random, tensorflow, tensorflow_hub, pathlib
* **Data source**: (https://github.com/DimitrisParaskevopoulos/Transfer-learning-feature-extraction/tree/main/dataset)
