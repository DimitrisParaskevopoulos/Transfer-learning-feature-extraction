# Feature extraction transfer learning for great results with small dataset
Transfer learning is leveraging what one model has learned on another dataset for our own dataset.

## Key features
* tensorboard callback to track ML training results
* feature extraction for accurate predictions since our dataset is similar to **ImageNet** where the TensorflowHub models were trained

## Code and Resources Used
* **Python version**: 3.9
* **Packages**: zipfile, os, matplotlib, datetime, random, tensorflow, tensorflow_hub, pathlib
* **Data source**: (https://github.com/DimitrisParaskevopoulos/Transfer-learning-feature-extraction/tree/main/dataset)
