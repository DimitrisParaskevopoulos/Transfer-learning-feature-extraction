# Feature extraction transfer learning for great results with small dataset
Transfer learning is leveraging what one model has learned on another dataset for our own dataset.

## Worthwile to mention
* mention how to import files of images and view random images
* use tensorboard callback to keep track results
* predictions in custom data with the use of two functions
* use power of feature extraction for accurate predictions as our dataset is similar to **ImageNet** where our TensorflowHub models were trained (if not fine-tuning would be an option)

## Code and Resources Used
* **Python version**: 3.9
* **Packages**: zipfile, os, matplotlib, datetime, random, tensorflow, tensorflow_hub, pathlib
* **Data source**: (https://github.com/DimitrisParaskevopoulos/Transfer-learning-feature-extraction/tree/main/dataset)
